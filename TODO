Things to do...
===============

  * avrdisas can currently only handle files <= 128kB (which is solely due to
    my laziness in writing a sophisticated prebuffer)
  * Theoretically, a bound-overflow buffer could occour when the buffer is
    completely at the end (128kB) and the last character indicates a 4-byte
	opcode. Then the next 3 bytes would be tried to also be read. This bug
	also exists solely due to my laziness.
  * Not all illegal jumps are being caught
  * Functions (addresses referenced by 'call') should be labeled "FunctionX:",
    not "LabelX:" - but that would only be neat and will probably fail because
	of my laziness
  * I'm not sure if avrdisas works correctly in all cases. If it doesn't,
    please drop me a note!
