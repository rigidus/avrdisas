Avrdisas
========

This is the README file of 'avrdisas', a little AVR microcontroller
disassembler. It supports all AVR opcodes and automatically labels
jump/call addresses (2-pass disassembly).



Who made this program?
======================

I am Johannes Bauer. You can reach me at JohannesBauer@gmx.de or check
my homepage (http://www.johannes-bauer.com) for updates.



How does it work?
=================

On the command-line, type
  # make
and, if you want to, as root
  # make install
Then the program can be invoked simply by "avrdisas"



How do I get it run on Windows?
===============================

Thanks to Kurt Binder there is support for Windows now. Simply add the
"DOS_BASED_OS" define to the compiling process, e.g. by issuing a
  # CFLAGS="-DDOS_BASED_OS" make
which should take care of all neccessary adjustments for Windows.



How are tagfiles being used?
============================

Tagfiles are a powerful utility to make your debugging life easier. Have 
a look at the tools/ package tag file (one which contains only labels) and
also look at the test/ packages for an example of a more advanced tag file.



What license is it uner?
========================

GPL-2. GNU General Public License Version 2. Also see the LICENSE file for
details.
